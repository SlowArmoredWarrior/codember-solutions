## Linting <a id="Linting"></a>
The whole project will be setted to be linted
with eslint and his google's plugin (is more 
stetic than others for my point of view) with 
the benefit wich you can disable **ONLY ONE 
RULE** (i selected the 'max-len' because is 
sometimes ugly to set too many lines in a for 
block ie)

## Testing <a id="Testing"></a>
By the moment each challenge has his own test case inside, but i think
in a future to install jest for making the tests validation

## Comments <a id="Comments"></a>
According the google rules, each function must have documentation in the 
JSDoc form, otherwise, variables and unexplicable code will have a single 
line code 

## Code <a id="Code"></a>
Code must be semanthically well written (not strictly but almost a little
comprehensible), recycling or splitting zones of redundant or silly procedural routines.

## Secrets <a id="Secrets"></a>
Secrets revelation are **NOT ALLOWED** because 
this is a guide not a cheat sheet and each 
peope wich take the challenges will need to 
solve by his/her own knowledge
